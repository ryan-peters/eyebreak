EyeBreak
========

**EyeBreak** is a macOS app designed to encourage healthier screen habits and alleviate eye strain. By adhering to the scientifically supported 20/20/20 rule, EyeBreak periodically reminds users to take breaks, thereby protecting eyesight and boosting productivity.

*   **20/20/20 Rule Reminders**: Users are subtly reminded every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
*   **Intuitive Pause Feature**: The app only tracks active screen time, pausing reminders automatically during periods of inactivity.
*   **Customizable Intervals**: Work and break durations can be personalized to fit individual preferences and working styles.
*   **Non-Intrusive Notifications**: Notifications are designed to be discreet, ensuring minimal disruption to focus and workflow.

Tech Stack
----------

**EyeBreak** is built using modern technologies and frameworks to ensure a seamless user experience on macOS:

*   **UI Framework**: SwiftUI for creating a dynamic and responsive interface.
*   **Programming Language**: Swift, for robust and efficient application logic.
*   **Notifications**: UserNotifications framework for scheduling discreet break reminders.
*   **System Integration**: AppKit for macOS-specific functionality and IOKit for monitoring idle times.
